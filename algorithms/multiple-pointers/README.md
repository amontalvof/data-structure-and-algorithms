## Multiple Pointers

The idea is that we create pointers or values that correspond to an index or position in an string or array and then move towards the beginning towards the end or towards each other in the middle based on a certain condition.

> The idea is that we are going to be searching for a pair of values or searching for something that meets the condition.
